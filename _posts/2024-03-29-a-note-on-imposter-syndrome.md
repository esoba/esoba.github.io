Imposter syndrome sucks - it's that constant "you arent good enough" or "someone else deserves to be in your place" feeling that you get when something good happens to you. I have struggled with imposter syndrome ever since I got to college, and even today I still get this feeling. After years of dealing with it, I want to offer my perspective and how a change in thinking has mitigated some of its effects. 

For me, imposter syndrome is like all of the super successful people you have ever known are at the top of a mountain. They are looking down, judging you, while you are at the base thinking about how much further you still need to climb. Everytime something good happens they are saying things like "that's not that impressive" and when something bad/undersirable happens they are saying "you see, I knew he wasn't cut out for this". 

This bottom of the mountain feeling can creep up at any point in the day, and it is always bound to cause some unneccesary anxiety, stress, and discomfort. The worst part is, it's really difficult to admit how you are feeling because imposter syndrome is directly attached to how you think people perceive you. 

If you tell someone who has had relatively less "success" than you, it's usually met with a "that's not even bad" or "you are still in such a good spot don't worry" - and thats completely fair. It's like telling someone who ate fast food you didn't like how your steak was cooked last night. Your bad day/time/experience could very well be someones good day/time/experience (definitely an exaggerated example).  

If you tell someone who has had more success than you, it's usually met with a "I've been there before, its okay" or "just keep grinding you got it" - also completely fair. It's a natural response to be sympathetic especially when you have been in someones shoes. However, to someone with imposter syndrome, its easy to forget that whoever is giving that advice got their success through some combination of hardwork, dedication, and luck. You assume that the more successful person got there due to sheer talent and that you just don't have that talent. 

Its also important to note that the concessions from the people trying to help/understand are not bad - it's just that it doesn't help break the mindset of imposter syndrome. Being able to confide in someone regardless of how successful they are is a luxury and shouldn't be taken for granted. My only caveat, from my own experience, is that it takes a lot of internal mental effort to begin viewing yourself/success in a different light. Make sure that you supplement confiding in others with your own self-reflection. 

I by no means have conquered my imposter syndrome, but over the years it has gotten significantly better by changing how I think about things.  

## How did we get here?

I read an unrelated quote recently that has really helped me internalize the uniqueness of the human experience.

> Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of whatâ€™s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. - Morgan Housel, Psychology of Money

Take out the "with money" portion and focus on just the numbers for a second. By the nature of decision making, the probability you ended up where you are is incredibly small (way smaller than that 0.00000001% mark). That's also the beauty about probability - no matter how improbable a sequence of events are, an outcome still occurs. 

To go off on a quick probability tangent to really drive home this point, imagine flipping a fair coin 1000 times. The most probable sequence (the expectation) would be 500 heads and 500 tails. The probability of seeing this sequence, despite it being the most probable, is only ~.02 or 2%. Raise the number of flips to 10000 and that number becomes .8% (the number keeps going down the more coins you flip).

Assuming your life's decisions were as easy as coin flips and you only made 10000 of them over your life time, the chances you end up in the most probable state is only .8%. Now consider the fact that you have made exponentially more than 10000 decisions, a majority of your decisions were not simple binary outcomes, decisions out of your control directly influenced your situation, and chances are you are not in the expected state of your decision making. The probability that you ended up where you are, whether it be by your own decisions or not, is so small we could not begin to comprehend the number. 

Side note and shameless plug: The primary area of ML that has to do with decision making, modelling human cognition/reward, and interacting with an environment is called reinforcement learning. It is a super interesting topic and one of my favorite things to learn about. I have a whole slew of blog posts about them, go check it out!

All of this is to say: everyones situation is unique and extremely improbable. As much as we like to admire uber successful people and super talented individuals, their current position came from an equally improbable sequence of decisions. Same goes for people who have not been as fortunate. Comparing situations, no matter how similar they may appear to be, seems a little less intuitive. Letting 80% of how we view our surroundings (or whatever number you choose) be based on insanely small chances of being in our given situation is way too disproportionate. 

## Am I actually good at Smash? 

The other day, my friends and I were having about Smash (Super Smash Bros Ultimate). I'd like to think I am decent at smash, but obviously not the best. It's one of my favorite games and I have spent an embarrasing amount of hours playing over the years. I play with my one friend who is definitely better than me, and when we play 1v1 he beats me ~67% of the time. During this interaction, someone asked him if I was good at Smash and his answer was "yeah he is really ******* good" to which I was like "really?"

Even though I know my friend is humble and wouldnt openly call out how often he beats me, it was still a slight shock to hear that. Maybe he just values his skills so highly that a 33% win rate is enough in his eyes to be really good? I asked him about it and he plainly said "I just think you are good at the game." This wasn't a super satisfactory answer because my imposter brain immediately defaulted to "how can you think that?", but it got me thinking about how hard it is to evaluate yourself.

Depending on your values, there can be many different metics for how success is defined. These could be money, happiness, comfortability, etc., but the point is that there is no well defined metric to say "you are __ successful". Going back to smash, I see how often I lose at smash and figure I am good but not great. For my friend, he takes how I play at face value and determines I'm really good. Because everyone has different values, it feels like perspective matters more than some universal or single metric.

I started realizing that when I get feelings of imposter syndrome, I am anchoring my metric for success to a single aspect of another person. Something like "this person makes more money than me" or "this person has been on publications more than me". All of these observations make me think that I am not good enough or should be doing more. 

Now, I think about how my success is tied to my own values, not single aspects. I know that despite my best efforts to learn more ML, publish more papers, work harder, etc. there is inevitably going to be people that have more success in those areas. That is okay! I am alligning my actions with my values and to me that matters more than comparison.


## Conclusion

I am not a psychologist or someone specialized in helping people conquer their imposter syndrome, I'm just someone who lives with it. If you resonate with the stories/sentiment, I just want you to know that you deserve the success you have, and I hope you have more! Some of those mindset changes really helped me and I hope it can help you too :grin:
