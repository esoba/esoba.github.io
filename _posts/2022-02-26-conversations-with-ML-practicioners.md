## Machine Learning Glossary 

Before diving in, I think it is useful to give some definitions before hand. Understanding these definitions, at the very least, will make conversations with ML professionals a lot easier 

| Term          | Definition    |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Artificial Intelligence      | right-aligned |
| Machine Learning     | centered      |
| Classification | are neat      |
| Regression      | right-aligned |
| Generative AI     | centered      |
| Natural Language Processing | are neat      |
| Computer Vision | are neat      |
| Natural Language Processing | are neat      |
| Cloud | are neat      |

I did omit some other important definitions/

## Difference between Traditional Computer Science and Machine Learning

The distinction between traditional computer science solutions and machine learning is very important because *specific problems require specific solutions*. It's really easy to get excited about the prospect of using Machine Learning to solve a problem; however, more likely than not, machine learning is not the answer. 

Traditional computer science solutions are related to problems that have a particular pattern or are clearly defined. Problem statements are turned into algorithms, which are then coded into a program. That program can be exported to others who can use it to solve their problems.

Machine learning solutions are related to problems whos answer can only be calculated by leveraging data about that problem. Compared to traditional computer science solutions, we don't know ahead of time what algorithm is needed to solve the problem. Instead, we rely on statistical models to learn patterns about the data to solve the problem for us.

*In both cases, coding is involved.* For traditional computer science problems, you directly code the algorithm that solves the problem. In Machine Learning, you code the data ingestion, model that needs to be trained, training procedure, etc. 

It is important to note that Machine Learning is math, but we need the processing power of computers to do this math. Thus, machine learning must be put into code. You can meet a computer scientist that does not know anything about machine learning, and likewise meet a machine learning expert who knows very little about computer science. At the end of the day, both groups will be coding. There is no magic behind machine learning, just math and code.  


## Why should you care about this difference

*To keep it short and sweet: money and time.*

If you have a large scale machine learning project, you need:
- Experts to work on it (slightly harder to come by)
- A lot of data (which you may have to pay for)
- An environment to train/test (GPUs are very expensive)
- The infastructure to maintain all the models/data/testing
- The tolerance to accept metrics that are not 100%
- The patience to allow countless tests to run and fail

Not to say that traditional computer science solutions do not require the points above, but for machine learning they are requirements 90% of the time. Go for the better and cheaper solutions first if possible. 



As the hype for Generative AI grows (as it should!), terms like ChatGPT, LLMs, AI, Machine Learning, etc. are all getting bundled together to mean the same thing. I think if you are someone who wants to use Generative AI, it is worth it to understand the  different terminology in the space and the basics behind how everything works. This will not only ground expectations for Generative AI applications, but also make it easier to talk to talent who will eventually make those applications.
