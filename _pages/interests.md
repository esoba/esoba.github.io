# Sports 
I am the type of person who at most points during the day is either: 
- Watching sports 
- Listening to sports content
- Fantasizing about playing sports 

Growing up I was always a "I just love the games I don't support a specific team". When I got to college, I remember my roommate asked me what teams I support, and that aforementioned thought was so foreign to him. He was a die hard Liverpool fan, so to him "just liking the game" is equivalent to being a casual (Liverpool fans don't get excitement from watching Man City even if they play beautiful football). Even though I didn't agree completely - he was right. Since then, I have been repping the following teams:
- Pistons* (NBA)
- Brighton* (EPL)
- Lions (NFL)
- All U of M sports (I'm an obnoxious Wolverine)

*Only caveats here are that I have a soft spot for whatever team LeBron or Messi, my goats, play for

# Cooking 
My grandma, the greatest chef ever, would always flood my house with the aroma of some incredible Ecuadorian food. It was always the thing I missed the most about being away from home. Cooking is truly an art and I have loved cooking all different kinds of things. Every time I step into the kitchen, I start thinking about me being on chopped/getting judged by Gordon Ramsey. Here are some of my favorite things to make lately:

- Carne guisada
- Encebollado de Atun
- Chicken Shawarma 
- Thai noodles

# Music 
Whatever I do throughout my day, with the exception of sleep, I always have some type of music playing. It may be a cliche, but I really do love all types of music and listen to a whole bunch of different artists/genres. I think that may be influenced by me listening to Pandora radio as my primary music provider until I was 16. 

Some of my favorite vinyls:
- Luv 4 Rent
- An Evening With Silk Sonic 
- Swimming
- Circles
- American Teen 
- SMITHEREENS

Also, I am unapologetically a podcast lisener. Here are some I listen to from time to time:
- Pardon My Take
- 2 Bears 1 Cave
- Huberman Podcast
- Modern Wisdom

I've been in a huge rut music wise lately, if you have any recommendations let me know!

# Gaming 
I am definitely not a hardcore gamer, but I love playing games of all sorts. I am always having a phase with some type of game, including (as of recent): 
- Fortnite 
- Rocket League
- Catan
- FIFA (or EAFC)
- Guitar Hero
- Fall Guys
- Suika (stupidly addicting)

If you have a good game suggestion please let me know all of those above frustrate me endlessly
