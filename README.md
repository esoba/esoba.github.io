# Welcome to my portfolio and blog! 

This page has the Jekyll structure for my portfolio and blog which was modified from [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). Big shout out to them for designing such an easy to use, sleek template (and shout out to Github for free hosting)

I wanted this to not only be a way to expose my self/skillset to the broader ML community, but also to be the resource I needed when I first started out. For code related to blog posts, visit my [platypus-ml-code repo](https://github.com/esoba/platypus-ml-code)
